                        <p>What is more interesting is that I have openly been expressing ideas on how we can improve and why we should implement different automatic and secure solutions with which to better organize the data we had. As a result, I have created many Excel and Access applications using Excel formulas, Pivot tables, VBA and SQL that have currently been used trough out all the teams.</p>
                        <p> I had also been a key figure in a project which is dedicated to develop a strategy to paperless maintain an aircraft based on SCRUM methodology. I lead a couple of Excel trainings for the colleagues.</p>

                        <p>My actual job characteristics allowed me to actively assist in implementing the Regulation 965 in the FO Manual. I took charge of maintaining the accuracy of the Operator’s documents whose holder is the Flight operations director, the board documentation of the aircraft and personal files of the crews. I tracked the validity dates of each of the crews’ licenses and qualifications and arranged initial and recurrent courses for continuing the qualifications of the crew and informing all the crew members for the upcoming courses/ trainings/ missions. I also assisted at preparing the documents for each flight and later archived the flight files.</p>
                        <p>What is more, I had had enough skills to create a complete managing solution for monitoring all crew’s licenses/ courses expiry dates as well as other routine work of the FOD based on the Flight operations manual via the means of Excel formulas. I had also created and maintained a site in WordPress with the data that is at high importance for the licenses and qualifications of the crew members.</p>
